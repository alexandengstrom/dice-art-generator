# Dice Art Generator
This project was created primarily for personal use inspired by the concept of using dice to recreate artworks. Each die face, displaying a different number of dots, represents varying levels of brightness, forming a pixelated image when arranged together.

The generator allows you to upload an image which is then scaled down to fit a specified dimension. Each pixel's brightness is classified into six levels, corresponding to the six sides of a die. The result is a layout that shows how to place the dice to replicate the image.

The tool provides:

- A preview of the generated dice artwork.
- Information about the dimensions of the artwork based on the size of the dice.
- An estimated cost calculation based on the price per dice you provide.
- The option to download a CSV file representing the dice placement schema, which can be used as a guide for arranging the dice.
